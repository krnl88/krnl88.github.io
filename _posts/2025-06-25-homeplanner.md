**Tech stack**: Node.js, PostgreSQL, REST API (Basiq.io)

As part of a collaborative backend project for HomePlanner.io, our team focused on building a new financial insights feature. My contributions included:

- Integrating the Basiq API to securely fetch user transaction data 
- Writing logic to insert or update transaction records in a PostgreSQL database. 

Basic error handling and checks to prevent duplicate entries are also implemented, ensuring smooth data flow to the front-end.
