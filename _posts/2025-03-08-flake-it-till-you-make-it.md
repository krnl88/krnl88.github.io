My client, Congo online book store, wants to expand its business to sell non-book items. However, the code base has some issues. Some fixes that I made includes:

- Enhance Code Reliability : Identified functions which might not return a value and modify them to make it clear that the returned value might be missing or invalid. 
- Improving Error Handling: Discover exception-related crashes and implemented error-handling features to ensure system stability.
- Reducing Code Duplication: Refactored repeated data structures and combined functionality into a more structured, easier-to-maintain design.

This project improved my ability to work with existing codebases using object-oriented principles and best practices in Java.
