I’m Karen Lee, a Software Technology student at Macquarie University, graduating in 2025. I’m passionate about coding because I find it incredible how you can build something just by typing on a computer. My goal is to create software that makes a real impact on people's lives.

While my primary focus is software development, I also explore other areas like business (influenced by my family background), data and analytics—especially since I love working with MySQL, or something completely random. I'm always open to learning new things!

Outside of coding, I love dancing! Unfortunately, I haven’t found many people who share this interest, so if you're up for it, feel free to hit me up.
